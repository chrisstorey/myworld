## Background

Having useful fakedata sources can be problematic. It is my aim to create a useful, multifaceted data source that holds
synthetic data for a large enough group of people to be relatively representative.

## Entities

The data will comprise:

* Household
  - Postcode

  * Location (Lat,Long)
  * Identifiers to regional and local government, etc
  * IMD and OAC
  * Household type
  * Number of adults, children, Over65 and dependants
  * Married identifier


* People
  * Names (including Surname with marriage rules)
  * Date of birth
  * Nationality which drives names
  * Occupation
  * Employment state
  * Health condition


* Income based on employment type
